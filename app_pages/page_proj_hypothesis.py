        f"Powdery mildew of sweet and sour cherry is caused by "
        f"Podosphaera clandestina, an obligate biotrophic fungus."
        f" Mid- and late-season sweet cherry (Prunus avium) cultivars"
        f" are commonly affected, rendering them unmarketable due to "
        f"the covering of white fungal growth on the cherry surface. \n\n"
        f"Initial symptoms, often occurring 7 to 10 days after the onset "
        f"of the first irrigation, are light roughly circular, "
        f"powdery-looking patches on young, susceptible leaves "
        f"(newly unfolded, and light green expanding leaves). "
        f"Older leaves develop an age-related (ontogenic) "
        f"resistance to powdery mildew and are naturally more resistant to "
        f"infection than younger leaves. Look for early leaf infections on "
        f"root suckers, the interior of the canopy, or the crotch of the"
        f" tree where humidity is high. \n\n"
        f" The disease is more likely to initiate on the "
        f"undersides (abaxial) of leaves but will occur"
        f" on both sides at later stages. As the season "
        f" progresses and infection is spread by wind, leaves may become "
        f"distorted, curling upward. Severe infections may cause leaves to "
        f"pucker and twist. Newly developed leaves on new shoots become "
        f"progressively smaller, are often pale, and may be distorted."
