# ðŸŒ¿ðŸŒ¿ **Mildew Detection in Cherry Leaves** ðŸŒ¿ðŸŒ¿

The Mildew Detection application was created for the fictitious company Farmy & Foods, and uses ML technology to allow users to upload images of cherry leaves for analysis. It can predict whether a cherry leaf is healthy or infected with powdery mildew and provides a downloadable report summarizing the findings.

## Dataset Content

- The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/codeinstitute/cherry-leaves). We then created a fictitious user story where predictive analytics can be applied in a real project in the workplace.

- The dataset contains +4 thousand images taken from the client's crop fields. The images show healthy cherry leaves and cherry leaves that have powdery mildew, a fungal disease that affects many plant species. The cherry plantation crop is one of the finest products in their portfolio, and the company is concerned about supplying the market with a compromised quality product.

## Business Requirements

The cherry plantation crop from Farmy & Foods is facing a challenge where their cherry plantations have been presenting powdery mildew. Currently, the process is manual verification if a given cherry tree contains powdery mildew. An employee spends around 30 minutes in each tree, taking a few samples of tree leaves and verifying visually if the leaf tree is healthy or has powdery mildew. If there is powdery mildew, the employee applies a specific compound to kill the fungus. The time spent applying this compound is 1 minute. The company has thousands of cherry trees located on multiple farms across the country. As a result, this manual process is not scalable due to the time spent in the manual process inspection.

To save time in this process, the IT team suggested an ML system that detects instantly, using a leaf tree image, if it is healthy or has powdery mildew. A similar manual process is in place for other crops for detecting pests, and if this initiative is successful, there is a realistic chance to replicate this project for all other crops. The dataset is a collection of cherry leaf images provided by Farmy & Foods, taken from their crops.

- 1 - The client is interested in conducting a study to visually differentiate a healthy cherry leaf from one with powdery mildew.
- 2 - The client is interested in predicting if a cherry leaf is healthy or contains powdery mildew.

## Hypothesis and how to validate?

- List here your project hypothesis(es) and how you envision validating it (them).

## The rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualisations and ML tasks

### ***Business Requirement 1:***

The client is interested in conducting a study to visually differentiate a healthy cherry leaf from one with powdery mildew.

> **Data Visualization**

- The dashboard will display the mean and standard deviation images for healthy and powdery mildew-infected cherry leaves.

- The contrast between an average healthy leaf and an average powdery mildew-infected leaf will be displayed.

- An image montage of healthy and powdery mildew-infected leaves will be presented.

### ***Business Requirement 2:***

The client is interested in predicting if a cherry leaf is healthy or contains powdery mildew.

> **Classification**

- Create a binary classifier ML model to predict whether a leaf is healthy or infected with powdery mildew. 

- Evaluate the performance of the Ml model for loss and accuracy.

- Create an option for users to generate and download a prediction report of uploadable images.

## Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM)

CRISP-DM was used while developing this project.

***1. Business understanding***

Business case assessment is provided by Code Institute.

> Business Requirement 1

Study should include analysis on:

- average images and variability images for each class (healthy or powdery mildew),
- the differences between average healthy and average powdery mildew cherry leaves,
- an image montage for each class

> Business Requirement 2:

- deliver an ML system that is capable of predicting whether a cherry leaf is healthy or contains powdery mildew

***2. Data Understanding***

The [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/codeinstitute/cherry-leaves) is provided by Code Institute over 4k images of healthy and affected cherry leaves.

- Data collection.

- Retrieve data from the Kaggle dataset  and save as raw data.

***3. Data Preparation***

- Clean data, check and remove non image files
- Split data into train validation and test set
- Set Image shape
- Average and variability of images per label
- Load image shapes and labels in an array
- Plot and save mean variability of images per label
- Difference between average healthy and powdery mildew contained leaf
- Image montage
- Image data augmentation

***4. Modelling***

- Create CNN model
- Fit created ML model with train set
- Save model

***4. Evaluation***

- Plot model learning curve for model training loss and accuracy
- Evaluate model on test set
- Load random image to predict
- Convert image to array and prepare for prediction.
- Predict class probabilities and evaluate.

## ML Business Case

***Using the given dataset of images, build a supervised, binary classification ML model to predict if a leaf is healthy or infected with powdery mildew.***

- **Data Collection:**

    Collect a image dataset of  healthy and powdery mildew-infected leaves.
- **Data Preprocessing:**

    Clean the non image files, check avarage image size, and split the data to train, validation and test sets.
- **Feature Extraction:**

    Use CNN to pull significant features from the images.
- **Model Selection:**

    Use CNN-based machine learning model for binary classification.
- **Model Training:**

    Train the model using the training set, and validate model performance with the validation set.
- **Model Evaluation:**

    Evaluate the trained model's performance with model learning curve and the validation set.
- **Model Testing:**

    Test the model's performance with different test datasets to evaluate its abstraction capability.

- **Deployment:**

    Deploy the trained model into production and incorporate it into an application where users can upload leaf images, get predictions, and download prediction reports.

## Dashboard Design

- List all dashboard pages and their content, either blocks of information or widgets, like buttons, checkboxes, images, or any other items, that your dashboard library supports.
- Finally, during the project development, you may revisit your dashboard plan to update a given feature (for example, at the beginning of the project, you were confident you would use a given plot to display an insight, but later, you chose another plot type).

## Unfixed Bugs

- You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were unfixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a significant variable for consideration, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

## Deployment

### Heroku

- The App live link is: `https://YOUR_APP_NAME.herokuapp.com/`
- Set the runtime.txt Python version to a [Heroku-20](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/python-support#supported-runtimes) stack currently supported version.
