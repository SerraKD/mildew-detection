## Dataset Content

- The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/codeinstitute/cherry-leaves). We then created a fictitious user story where predictive analytics can be applied in a real project in the workplace.

- The dataset contains +4 thousand images taken from the client's crop fields. The images show healthy cherry leaves and cherry leaves that have powdery mildew, a fungal disease that affects many plant species. The cherry plantation crop is one of the finest products in their portfolio, and the company is concerned about supplying the market with a compromised quality product.

## Business Requirements

The cherry plantation crop from Farmy & Foods is facing a challenge where their cherry plantations have been presenting powdery mildew. Currently, the process is manual verification if a given cherry tree contains powdery mildew. An employee spends around 30 minutes in each tree, taking a few samples of tree leaves and verifying visually if the leaf tree is healthy or has powdery mildew. If there is powdery mildew, the employee applies a specific compound to kill the fungus. The time spent applying this compound is 1 minute. The company has thousands of cherry trees located on multiple farms across the country. As a result, this manual process is not scalable due to the time spent in the manual process inspection.

To save time in this process, the IT team suggested an ML system that detects instantly, using a leaf tree image, if it is healthy or has powdery mildew. A similar manual process is in place for other crops for detecting pests, and if this initiative is successful, there is a realistic chance to replicate this project for all other crops. The dataset is a collection of cherry leaf images provided by Farmy & Foods, taken from their crops.

- 1 - The client is interested in conducting a study to visually differentiate a healthy cherry leaf from one with powdery mildew.
- 2 - The client is interested in predicting if a cherry leaf is healthy or contains powdery mildew.

## Hypotheses and how to validate?

### ***Hypotheses***

- There are visible pattern differences between healthy and infected cherry leaf images that can be used to differentiate between healthy and powdery mildew-affected leaves.

- There are distinct color and nuanced shape differences between healthy and powdery mildew-infected cherry leaves.

- A machine learning model can be developed using the provided image dataset to predict whether a leaf is infected with powdery mildew with minimum 97% acccuracy.

### ***Validation***

- The Image Montage shows the apparent difference between healthy and powdery mildew-infected leaves.

![Image montage healthy leaves](/docs/readme/img-mont-healthy.png)
![Image montage mildew leaves](/docs/readme/img-mont-mildew.png)

- Average, Variability, and Difference Images confirmed the hypothesis by showing color differences within the center of each leaf image, yet there are no clear patterns to identify them by shape.

![Average Healthy](/outputs/v1/avg_var_healthy.png)
![Average Infected](/outputs/v1/avg_var_powdery_mildew.png)
![Difference](/outputs/v1/avg_diff.png)

- ML pipeline performance evaluation shows that it differentiates a healthy leaf from an infected leaf with 99% accuracy.

### ***Business Requirement 2:***

The client is interested in predicting if a cherry leaf is healthy or contains powdery mildew.

> **Classification**

- Create a binary classifier ML model to predict whether a leaf is healthy or infected with powdery mildew. 

- Evaluate the performance of the Ml model for loss and accuracy.

- Create an option for users to generate and download a prediction report of uploadable images.
